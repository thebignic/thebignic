<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

I'm a JS and TS script developer, focusing mainly on Discord tools. Although I mainly make Discord bots and similar things, I also love web development, web scraping, and Python development. Although it probably looks as though I only have a few projects, that's just because I'm not really much of an open source developer, and I keep a lot of my repositories private rather than setting them up for the use of other people. I'm hoping to create some more open source projects in the future, though!
